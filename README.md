Python Maprooms that are also a Tutorial to learn how to make them.

We are building Maproom Applications with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction)
and with [Dash-Leaflet](https://dash-leaflet.herokuapp.com/) for the mapping components.

We are performing data analysis with [Xarray](https://xarray.dev/),
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
